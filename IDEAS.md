# Transparent Camera Project - Future Ideas

The transparent camera project has a lot of room for improvement.  Below is an unordered list of items that we have brainstormed that could be done to improve the project.

- Design a case for the Raspberry Pi 5 that fits into the transparent camera's frame.
- Continue training the pix2pixHD model on larger more diverse datasets with more epochs.
- Consider switching from a pix2pixHD model to a GauGAN model for image reconstruction.
