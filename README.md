# Transparent Camera Project

The transparent camera project is a camera project with the goal of being able to take pictures from the side of a piece of acrylic.  In other words, the camera would look just like a regular window however, it could take photos.  A camera of this type would be extremely beneficial for a variety of applications such as AR and VR.
