1.) CameraFrame_2.20 is the printed frame used to collect data. It was created on SolidWorks and needs an update for the dimensions of the acrylic glass  

2.) CameraMount, ballnut, raspicamback, raspicamcover_lense, and thumb_bolt were assembled together to hold up the ground truth camera. The groove on the Camera Frame is incorrect and needs to be updated to fit correctly.  

3.) A beneficial update would include a cover for the pi to protect from physical damage and ESD.  

4.) DocWeebl designed most of the parts for the camera cover, but the CameraMount STL and SLDPRT files were designed by this group. A link to his work has been included below.
