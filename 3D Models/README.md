# Transparent Camera Project - 3D Models

This folder contains the 3D models used to create the hardware of the transparent camera.

A beneficial update to the camera's hardware would be to include a cover for the Raspberry Pi 5 to protect it from physical damage and ESD.

DocWeebl designed most of the parts for the camera cover, but the CameraMount STL and SLDPRT files were designed by this group. A link to his work has been included below:
